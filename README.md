# Galleria-slideshow-site

Frontend Mentor - Galleria slideshow site - HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT

Stuff I learned:

- trying to force GRID to do what you want might mean that flexbox is the answer. Those 4 hours I will never get back.
- "pointer-events" a usefull css attribute that allows the mouse to ignor that element. Had an issue where the hover on the image would be interrupted due to the text-div.
- I managed to get the JSON data to parce into the webpage okay. Now need to figureout how to load the data of the picture to a website template!
